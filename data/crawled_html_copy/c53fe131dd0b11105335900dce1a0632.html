<h5 class="font-bold mb-3">Introduction</h5>
<p id="ember40">Sustainability is a key strategic priority in the modern economic landscape. As climate change continues to be a growing concern, businesses are striving to reduce their carbon footprint and aim for carbon neutrality. This means finding ways to reduce emissions, offsetting the ones that cannot be avoided, and investing in renewable energy sources.</p>
<p id="ember41">Building sustainable supply chains to contribute to a circular economy with renewable energy and zero waste is at the crux of most business growth plans. But how can a company transition to a sustainable business model? How does it help in creating a competitive advantage? Let’s dive in!</p>
</div>
<div class="contentItm mb-4" id="Whyswitchtoasustainablegrowthstrategy">
<h5 class="font-bold mb-3">Why switch to a sustainable growth strategy?</h5>
<p id="ember43">Although the pace of change is inconsistent, it is undeniable that businesses in various sectors have already begun transforming to offer more sustainable products and services. A shift from fossil-fuel-based vehicles to electric vehicles is a notable example. It is evident that similar transformations will need to occur in all industries with varied priorities and the speed of implementation.</p>
<figure class="wp-block-image size-large"></figure>
</div>
<div class="contentItm mb-4" id="AdaptingtoConsumerBehavior">
<h5 class="font-bold mb-3">Adapting to Consumer Behavior</h5>
<p id="ember46">As consumers shift towards more sustainable products and services, businesses must adapt their models to remain relevant. Whether driven by external pressures such as increasing regulations on a global scale, or by an internal desire to make a positive impact on the world, companies face a daunting challenge of transformation while optimizing their triple bottom line.</p>
<p id="ember47">While this move towards sustainability has not always been without its challenges, catering to customer demands for “green” products can also increase sales and profits. Moreover, adopting waste reduction and more efficient operating methods can help reduce costs and boost profitability.</p>
</div>
<div class="contentItm mb-4" id="BuildingTransparency">
<h5 class="font-bold mb-3">Building Transparency</h5>
<p id="ember49">With a growing awareness of the need to “Go Green”, businesses are being held accountable for their social impact, including issues such as diversity, equity, and inclusion, labor practices, and community engagement. Stakeholders, including customers, investors, and regulators, are demanding more transparency and accountability from businesses when it comes to their sustainability efforts. This includes reporting on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) performance.</p>
<p id="ember50">But no business changes their ways just for the sake of being sustainable. What’s in it for them?</p>
</div>
<div class="contentItm mb-4" id="GainingCompetitiveAdvantage">
<h5 class="font-bold mb-3">Gaining Competitive Advantage</h5>
<p id="ember52">Leading businesses and industry giants have adopted a sustainable growth model to not only be in the good books of their customers but gain a competitive edge over those who fail to communicate their sustainability efforts to the stakeholders. In response to the shift in consumer trends, many corporations have launched advertising campaigns that seek to assure consumers of their commitment to sustainable policies.</p>
<p id="ember53">The aim is to future-proof your business and create long-term value for the stakeholders by supporting a circular economy. Ultimately, striking a balance between sustainability and profitability benefits both businesses and the environment.</p>
</div>
<div class="contentItm mb-4" id="Howcanacompanytransitiontoasustainablebusinessmodel">
<h5 class="font-bold mb-3">How can a company transition to a sustainable business model?</h5>
<p id="ember55">Tesla, Unilever, Interface are some examples of industry giants who have successfully adopted sustainability across all products and services. In building a sustainable growth model, these businesses focused on three questions:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Do our products and services embody sustainability?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Are their lifecycles, from sourcing materials to consumption, designed to be sustainable?</strong></li>
<li><strong>What do our customers and prospects expect to see in terms of sustainability?</strong></li>
</ol>
<p id="ember57">Advances in green technology, such as renewable energy, energy-efficient buildings, and electric vehicles, are making it easier for businesses to reduce waste and carbon footprint across supply chains. At the same time, it is also essential to consider the customer perspective when developing new sustainable business models. This is where SAP Sustainability solutions such as Business Process Intelligence (BPI) can be particularly valuable.</p>
<p id="ember58">BPI can help organizations to visualize their customers’ sustainability journeys and assess how their current business processes support these journeys, as well as identifying areas that require improvement. By leveraging BPI, businesses can gain insight into their customers’ needs and preferences and ensure that their sustainable business model aligns with these expectations. This, in turn, can help to increase customer satisfaction and loyalty, while also contributing to a more sustainable future for all.</p>
<p id="ember59">GROW with SAP is another move aimed towards empowering businesses to scale their operations while maintaining sustainability. By adopting innovative technologies such as the Internet of Things and blockchain, businesses can gain greater visibility into their supply chains, reduce their carbon footprint, and create more sustainable products and services.</p>
<p id="ember60">By leveraging the capabilities of SAP and Cognitus, you can ensure that your business objectives are in sync with the sustainable development goals to make the most of a positive brand identity.</p>
