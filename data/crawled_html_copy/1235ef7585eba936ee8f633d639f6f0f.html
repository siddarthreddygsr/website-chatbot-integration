<h5 class="font-bold mb-3">Introduction to Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)</h5>
<p>Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a neural architecture that combines the strengths of large pre-trained language models with external retrieval or search mechanisms. The main goal of the RAG architecture is to improve the capability of language models by allowing them to pull relevant information from a vast corpus, similar to how search engines retrieve relevant web pages based on queries. RAG is used for various tasks such as question answering and knowledge-intensive NLP tasks. This architecture represents a fusion of retrieval-based and generation-based approaches to NLP.</p>
</div>
<div class="contentItm mb-4" id="HowRAGWorks">
<h5 class="font-bold mb-3">How RAG Works</h5>
<p class="ember-view reader-content-blocks__paragraph" id="ember56">The RAG architecture enhances the capabilities of language models through a three-step process:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Question Encoding</strong>: The user provides a question or prompt, which is then encoded by a sequence-to-sequence model into a dense vector.</li>
<li><strong>Document Retrieval</strong>: This dense vector is used as a query to retrieve relevant documents or passages from a large corpus. The retrieval is typically done using a dense vector space search, where documents in the corpus are pre-embedded in the same dense vector space. The top most relevant documents or passages are retrieved based on their proximity to the query vector.</li>
<li><strong>Answer Generation</strong>: The retrieved documents and the original question are fed into a Large Language Model to generate an answer. The model is fine-tuned on a downstream task to generate relevant responses based on both the input question and the retrieved passages.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<div class="contentItm mb-4" id="TheSAPBTPRAGArchitecture">
<h5 class="font-bold mb-3">The SAP BTP RAG Architecture</h5>
<p>The provided architecture diagram showcases a CAP-based multi-tenant SaaS architecture utilizing RAG. This architecture is designed to seamlessly combine various Large Language Models (LLMs) using SAP AI Core. By leveraging the capabilities of LangChain in the CAP model and implementing advanced methods such as custom schema-based output parsing or Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with embeddings and a vector database, businesses can maximize the benefits for their specific needs.</p>
