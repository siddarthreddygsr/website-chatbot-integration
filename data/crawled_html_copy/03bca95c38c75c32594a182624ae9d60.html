<h5 class="font-bold mb-3">Overview</h5>
<p id="ember38">Redesigning business processes and adopting new technologies are key to driving agility across your business and staying on top of your industry. Back in 2021, SAP announced their highly successful business transformation service, RISE with SAP, to help customers on the path to intelligent enterprise. Just last month they announced another program, GROW with SAP, tailored towards midsize companies looking for a swift, out-of-the-box cloud solution.</p>
<p id="ember39">But how is RISE with SAP different than GROW with SAP? To answer that, first let’s understand how GROW with SAP helps to unlock business potential and empower growth capabilities.</p>
</div>
<div class="contentItm mb-4" id="WhatisGROWwithSAP">
<h5 class="font-bold mb-3">What is GROW with SAP?</h5>
<p id="ember41">The mid-size market has been a hotbed of innovation in recent years, with many unique and unconventional ideas and product-service offerings emerging. Despite this growth, mid-market leaders face various macro and micro economic challenges such as inflation, supply chain disruptions, and skill gaps that make it challenging to sustain growth. To combat these challenges, SAP launched GROW with SAP to help make the full suite of cloud ERP solutions accessible to small and midsize businesses.</p>
<p id="ember42">GROW with SAP focuses solely on SAP S/4HANA Cloud, public edition, and is geared towards small and mid-sized clients. But what does it offer?</p>
<ul>
<li>Rapid cloud ERP deployment and time to value for midsize customers</li>
<li>Simplified evaluation and deployment processes</li>
<li>Access to real-time insights to help customers optimize rollout plans</li>
<li>Encompasses SAP Business Technology Platform, which enables customers to develop their own processes in a cloud-native fashion using SAP Build.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<div class="contentItm mb-4" id="ShouldyouRISEorGROWwithSAPWhatsthedifference">
<h5 class="font-bold mb-3">Should you RISE or GROW with SAP – What’s the difference?</h5>
<p id="ember45">GROW with SAP and RISE with SAP are two different programs offered by SAP to drive top-line, bottom-line, and green-line growth by transforming mission-critical systems and mitigating business risk. But how are they different?</p>
<p id="ember46">RISE with SAP is a program that is designed to help businesses of all sizes transition to the cloud and modernize their operations. It provides businesses with access to a suite of services and solutions that help them migrate to SAP’s cloud platform and take advantage of the latest technologies and innovations. In addition, it allows customers to truly customize their path to digital transformation.</p>
<p id="ember47">On the other hand, GROW with SAP is a program that is designed to allow small to midsize businesses to scale quickly and effectively with a solution that can support hyper growth. It provides businesses with access to services and solutions that help them optimize their operations, improve customer engagement, and drive growth. It’s a complete offering of solutions, best practices, adoption acceleration services, and community and learning.</p>
<p id="ember48">Unlike RISE with SAP, GROW with SAP is focused on mid-sized clients who may or may not be existing SAP customers. It provides access to SAP Community and SAP Learning site, allowing small and mid-market players to engage and learn in a collaborative, open community of SAP experts, partners, and customers.</p>
<p id="ember49">SAP’s offering is designed to radically simplify buying, deploying, and optimizing enterprise apps in the cloud for a new genre. With GROW, SAP unleashes a new market of implementation services for mid-size businesses that are eager to move to the cloud but have been waiting for a clear blueprint.</p>
<p id="ember50">In short, GROW with SAP focuses on enabling organizations to achieve their business goals by providing a comprehensive set of solutions and services that support growth and innovation, while RISE with SAP focuses on delivering a simplified and integrated solution for businesses to become more resilient, adaptable, and sustainable.</p>
</div>
<div class="contentItm mb-4" id="HowdoesGROWwithSAPbenefityourbusiness">
<h5 class="font-bold mb-3">How does GROW with SAP benefit your business?</h5>
<p id="ember52">I think GROW with SAP will be the tipping point for many businesses that are eager to change but have been waiting for a clear roadmap,” says Adam James, head of Professional Services at Cognitus. “And when you add the tools and methodologies, activation services and community support, moving to the cloud becomes irresistible.” Some of the key benefits of GROW with SAP include:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Improved customer engagement</strong>: The program provides businesses with advanced customer experience management tools that help them engage with customers across multiple channels and touchpoints.</li>
<li><strong>Enhanced productivity</strong>: The program provides businesses with advanced analytics and reporting tools that help them gain insights into their operations and make informed decisions that drive growth and improve efficiency.</li>
<li><strong>Increased agility</strong>: The program provides businesses with access to a suite of services and solutions that help them adapt to changing market conditions and customer demands.</li>

<h5 class="font-bold mb-3">What should you choose for your business?</h5>
<p id="ember56">Ultimately, the decision between GROW with SAP and RISE with SAP will depend on your organization’s specific needs, priorities, and goals. Depending upon the size of your business and the growth objectives, SAP has defined GROW and RISE to ensure a seamless transition to cloud which opens your business to endless possibilities of growth.</p>
<p id="ember57">While RISE with SAP is focused on helping businesses of all sizes transition to the cloud and modernize their operations, GROW with SAP is focused on helping mid-market businesses optimize their operations, improve customer engagement, and drive growth.</p>
